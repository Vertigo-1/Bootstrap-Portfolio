              Hi, my name is Teddy. I'm Greek, and always looking for new
              experiences. My mantra is YOLO, you only live once. Skydiving,
              mountain climbing, hiking, and more. My YOLO list for 2019 is as
              follows: snowboarding, paragliding and more mountain climbing.
              Growing up eating greek food most of the time has turned me into a
              foodie and I'm thankful for that!
            </p>

              I used to fix computers since age 10. I didn't have a good
              experience with technical support so I took it upon myself to
              learn troubleshooting steps. The computer manual was there and I
              started reading. Fast forward a couple of years and I graduated
              with Computer Science degree at Queens College.

              Finding a job wasn't easy... Entry level positions with 3 years
              experience required while unreasonable were what I could find.
              After a few months of searching I finally found a technical
              support position at Columbia Psychiatry. It was a volunteer job
              but I was greatful to earn some experiance.

              After 6 months, I was offered a job and from there I was working
              above my pay grade. Building image servers, MBAM servers and
              assisting with administrative tasks. I was up for anything. I was
              very lucky that there were co-workers that appreciated my help and
              would help me in return. Unfortunately, opportunities for
              advancement within were not readily available and I had no choice
              but to look for another job. Finally, within about 2 months I
              recieved three offers for an administrator positions. I currently
              work as a systems engineer/administrator for a Managed Service
              Provider. We manage over 180 clients, mainly in finance.
